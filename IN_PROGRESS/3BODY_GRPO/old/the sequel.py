""""""solving"""""""" the 3 body problem - 2nd planet jiu jitsu
you live on a planet that orbits 3 suns. this sucks. your people burn or freeze to death or fall into the sun
historically, predicting these chaotic eras never works. 
but maybe you can alter them! after all, you are a mass.



you escape your cruddy environment, and now your people are safe. you can finally rest. you lay down to nap, and close your eyes..

..only to realize it was all a dream!! you look up and see 6 suns in the sky! and oh, what's.. that? another planet? and they have a jet too?


being smarter than everybody else in your world, you take it upon yourself to contact them without asking anyone. "is anyone there?" a reply: "I am a pacifist of this world. I am warning you.." oh shit. they're gonna kill us



having no weaponry (you spend all your planet's productivity on building a jet) your only option is to kill them by throwing them into a sun. but they'll also be trying to throw you into a sun, so be careful!
