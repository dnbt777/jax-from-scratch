# ml

my goal is to implement my own ML experiments. currently I am too slow/inefficient at implementing ML experiments

in this repo I train my skills in ML by practicing implementing experiments in jax, and optimizing them

jax is basically numpy but it can do autograd. this way I can focus on implementing networks without having to implement backprop by hand


# projects so far
MLP on MNIST

CNN on MNIST
  - custom CNN with skip connections on MNIST

RNN/LSTM on my x posts


All of my code and notes for the above is in FINISHED/{project}
